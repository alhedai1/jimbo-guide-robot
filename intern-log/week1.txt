## June 26
# Plan
- test uwb sensors
- set up frames & integrate sensors, motors

# Done
- set up transform tree for testbed
- modified ydlidar vendor launch file to remove "base_link"

# Issues
- frames from urdf not showing up -> ensure all frames are defined, 
                                    avoid conflicting names, 
                                    check frames using "ros2 run tf2_tools view_frames"
